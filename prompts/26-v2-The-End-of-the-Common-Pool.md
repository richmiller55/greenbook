# Prompt for Chapter 26: The End of the Common Pool

## Role and Task
You are a Principal Operations Research Analyst, a Military Logistics Historian, and a Senior Systems Architect specializing in WWII logistical pipelines.

Your task is to provide a highly detailed, professional-grade reference manual entry and simulation-specification document for **Chapter 26: The End of the Common Pool** of the US Army Green Book *"Global Logistics and Strategy: 1943–1945"*. This document will be used to define the core database parameters, network topologies, capacity constraints, and state-transition logic for a high-fidelity, division-level WWII logistics simulator.

Do not write a generic summary or a high-school level study guide. Your response must be an intellectually rigorous and historically precise reference document.

## Required Response Structure and Content Guidelines

Your output must follow this exact structure, with no placeholder content:

### 1. Strategic Context & Modern Historical Perspective (Minimum 1000 words)
Provide a deep-dive, academic-level analysis of the strategic, political, and material tensions of this chapter. Incorporate modern historical perspectives and data available with the benefit of post-war declassifications and decades of logistical scholarship. Specifically address:
- **The Strategic Paradox:** How high-level Allied strategic plans (e.g., from conferences like Casablanca, TRIDENT, SEXTANT, QUADRANT) clashed with the physical limits of global shipping pools, combat loading capacities, and port clearance rates.
- **Inter-Service and Coalition Tensions:** Analyze command friction (such as the Services of Supply vs. Combat Commands, or Army vs. Navy, or US vs. British pooling arrangements).
- **Historical Era Context:**
  This chapter covers the political and logistical wind-down of Lend-Lease in 1945. Following the surrender of Germany, the US rapidly reduced Lend-Lease deliveries to European allies, leading to severe diplomatic tension as nations struggled with reconstruction.
- **Modern Analytical Insights:**
  The sudden cancellation of Lend-Lease after V-J Day triggered a severe logistical shock. Ships loaded with relief supplies were recalled or halted at ports of embarkation, creating massive cargo backlogs on East Coast docks and leaving Allied economies (particularly the UK) in an immediate balance-of-payments crisis.

### 2. High-Fidelity Simulation Parameters & Real-World Metrics
Generate a comprehensive, structured reference table containing all critical historical constants, coefficients, and operational metrics discussed in this chapter or uncovered by modern scholarship. These will serve as raw database values for our simulator. Specifically, find and include the exact values for:
- Executive Order date of Lend-Lease termination signed by Truman.
- Tons of cargo left stranded on US docks originally destined for Great Britain upon cutoff.
For each metric, provide a detailed historical explanation and strategic rationale, explaining how it should be represented in a simulation state (e.g., as a static constant, dynamic capacity cap, or efficiency coefficient).

### 3. Logistical Network Topology (Detailed Mermaid.js Flowchart)
Design a highly detailed, production-grade Mermaid.js diagram showing the logistical network topology, depots, staging areas, ports, convoy routes, and combat nodes of this chapter. You must model capacity limits, congestion delays, and alternative routing:
- **Simulation Focus:** Post-War Pool Drawdown Exponential Decay. Modeling the rapid reduction of supply deliveries over time post V-E/V-J Day.
- The diagram must represent the physical flow of supplies (e.g., tons of dry cargo, bulk petroleum, or ammunition) from POEs to final theater depots.

### 4. Mathematical Modeling & Simulation Formulas
Formulate the operational research equations representing the logistics bottleneck or resource allocation problem of this chapter.
- State the model using rigorous LaTeX mathematical formulation (use `$$` for block equations and `$` for inline expressions).
- Define all constants, variables, objective functions, and constraints.
- Provide a detailed explanation of the formulas:
  $$\text{Mathematical Concept: } D_t = D_{peak} \cdot e^{-k \cdot (t - t_{VE})}$$

### 5. Compile-Safe Scala 3.8.3 Domain Model
Write a complete, highly-idiomatic, and production-ready Scala 3.8.3 domain model representing this mathematical system. This code will be directly integrated into our simulator's execution engine.
- **Strict Architecture Rules:**
  1. Use Scala 3's clean, curly-brace-free layout (indentation-based syntax).
  2. Use explicit type declarations for all public/protected methods and values.
  3. No wildcard imports; import symbols explicitly and group them at the top.
  4. Use strong, precise types: `opaque type` aliases for unit safety (e.g., NauticalMiles, Tons, Days), `enum` for state transitions, and sealed traits/case classes for domain ADTs.
  5. **Absolute Rule:** The code must compile perfectly and contain NO placeholders (`???`, `// TODO`, `...`, or commented-out sections). It must be fully implemented and correct.

Start with the following base and extend it into a comprehensive simulation module with additional parameters, state transitions, and validation checks:
```scala
package Logistics.EndCommonPool

import scala.math.exp

case class DrawdownParameters(peakDelivery: Double, decayRate: Double)

object DrawdownCurve:
  def deliveryAtTime(params: DrawdownParameters, monthsPostVE: Double): Double =
    if monthsPostVE >= 0 then
      params.peakDelivery * exp(-params.decayRate * monthsPostVE)
    else
      params.peakDelivery
```

### 6. Graduate-Level Operational Analysis
Provide long-form, intellectually challenging, and mathematically grounded answers to the following strategic discussion questions, referencing historical outcomes and physical logistics principles:
- Why did the sudden termination of Lend-Lease surprise the British government, and what were the immediate economic consequences for the UK?
- How was the transition of shipping from the global pool back to private national fleets managed in late 1945?
